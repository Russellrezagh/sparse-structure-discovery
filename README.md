SSD: Sparse Structure Discovery

1. Tutorial Jupyter notebook
2. Python script that generates factorizer objects for the data analyzed in the paper
3. Notebooks generating the figures presented in the paper
4. Utils folder containing code that executes our ssd method (ssd.py) and stores solutions across a range of regularization values (factorizer.py)

QTL: Multi-phenotype QTL mapping.

This folder contains joint_qtl_mapping.py, which executes our joint QTL mapping pipeline. Code in this folder recreates the QTL mapping on the BBQ dataset. See README in folder for further description.
